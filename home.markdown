TCCW was established in 1979 by local parents and is still run today as a not for profit charity overseen by a voluntary management committee. TCCW is a much valued and loved part of the community and being run by parents for parents enables us to offer a unique childcare experience.

At TCCW we offer children a range of structured and free play opportunities. Children have access to toys, games, crafts, books, dens, dressing up. We also take children on trips to the local park and further afield during holiday club.
